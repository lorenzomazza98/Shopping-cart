# Shopping-cart

Shopping Cart in Language C:


We want to simulate the automatic management of the shopping cart. A user can purchase products and automatically place them in the shopping cart. Each product is identified by a code, name, description, cost and any offer.
Allow the user to:
• Make purchases by adding to the shopping cart. The system
view the partial account with any discounts.
• Sort and view products by name (use the sorting algorithm by insertion).
• Delete a purchase given its name.
Carry out at least one test for each option required.
